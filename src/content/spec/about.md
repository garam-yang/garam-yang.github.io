# About
Hi, I'm Juhyeon Kim, from South Korea.
I’m training to become a pilot while building projects at the intersection of aviation and software engineering, recently exploring ideas that combine flight training communities with data platforms similar to CloudAhoy.

Before focusing on aviation, I spent a year studying software development through a program at Samsung, where I built a foundation in engineering.

Outside the cockpit and code, I compose music in Logic Pro and hope to release my own album on SoundCloud within the next two years.

I used to be part of a Taekwondo demonstration team until a knee injury changed my direction.

My nickname, Garam Yang, “Yang” comes from my mother’s family name. In Korea, women keep their surnames after marriage, and “Garam” is an old Korean word meaning temple or river. I’ve always appreciated Buddhist philosophy, which is why you’ll see a lotus in my banner.

I started this blog to document what I learn, help people across different fields, and hopefully inspire someone along the way.
