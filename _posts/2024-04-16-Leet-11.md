```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        i, j = 0, len(height)-1
        mx = 0
        while i < j:
          # point 1. For calculating 'area', we have to find 'height' of 'area'.
          # k is the 'height' of it
            k = min(height[i], height[j])
            amount = (j-i)*k
          # point 2. For finding and renewing the max amount as this problem's condition,    
          # we have to method of 'max'.
            mx = max(mx, amount)
            if height[i] < height[j]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        return mx
        

```

# Summary

1. For calculating 'area', we have to find 'height' of 'area'. 'k' is the 'height' of it
2. For finding and renewing the max amount as this problem's condition, we have to method of 'max' .
