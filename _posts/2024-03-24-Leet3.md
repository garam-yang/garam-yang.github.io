# Summary. 

1. For the case of 'No elements' in 'nums', you have to write this code..! If there is no this code? It will make errors.  
2. To make 'reset', you have to write this code to prevent for 'resetting again' problem.  
3. For making 'update' for max_sum(=the answer of this problem), you have to write this code.
