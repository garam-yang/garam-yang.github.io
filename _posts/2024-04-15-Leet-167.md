```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # At first, two pointer is used for making 'O(n^2)'(if using two for loof...) to 'O(N)'
        i, j =0, len(numbers)-1 # This is line for normal setting of 'two pointer'. I think that's just convention when you solve this kind of problem.

        # only using 'while loof' of O(N) is much better than using 'adding conditional statesment in that while loof for checking'
        # we just need to moving two pointers until finding target.
        while numbers[i] + numbers[j] != target:
            s = numbers[i] + numbers[j]        
            if s > target: # That's just typical condition for checking all the elements of the list.
              
              # By that we can move 'i' index and 'j' index.
                j -= 1
            else:
                i += 1 
                
        return [i + 1 , j + 1]
```

# Summary

1.At first, two pointer is used for making 'O(n^2)'(if using two for loof...) to 'O(N)'. 

```python
i, j =0, len(numbers)-1 
```

This is line for normal setting of 'two pointer'. I think that's just convention when you solve this kind of problem.

2.```python
           while numbers[i] + numbers[j] != target:
               s = numbers[i] + numbers[j]        
               if s > target: 
                   j -= 1
               else:
                   i += 1 
   ```

   That's just typical condition for checking all the elements of the list. By that, we can move 'i' index and 'j' index.
